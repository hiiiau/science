a logical fallacy is an argument that may sound convincing or true but is actually flawed.

logical fallacies are leaps of logic that lead us to an unsupported conclusion

### the straw man fallacy

a straw man fallacy occurs when an argument is distorted or exaggerated, and that distorted version was attacked

### ad hominem fallacy

an attempt to discredit someone's argument with personal attacks

### appeal to authority fallacy

instead of justifying the claim, cite an authority figure who did not have evidence to make a statement

### black and white fallacy

this involves presenting a limited number of options as if they were the only options available.
it assumes that there is no middle ground

### no true scotsman fallacy

attempt to defend a generalisation by denying the validity of any counterexamples given
it changes the definition of who or what belongs to a group or category

### slippery slope fallacy

when you argue that a relatively small first step will lead to a chain of related, progressively worse effects.

### begging the question fallacy

argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion and therefore are not good premises
