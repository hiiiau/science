### necessary conditions

A is a necessary condition for B, if and only if, an instance of B requires the instance of A to be true. [B=A]

a necessary condition is required for something to be the case. not meeting these conditions proves the falsity of the claim.

if you want to be mud, you have to be wet. if you're not wet, you're not mud.

### sufficient conditions

A is a sufficient condition for B, if and only if, an instance of A guarantees the instance of B. [A=B]

a sufficient condition is enough to prove that something is the case. the truth of the condition is enough to guarantee the truth of the claim.

mud is wet, therefore, if it is mud, it is wet.
