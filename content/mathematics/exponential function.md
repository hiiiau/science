in mathematics, an [[exponentiation|exponential]] function is a function in the form $f(x)=a\cdot c^{b(x-h)}+k$

it is different from [[power function]]

by the way, another way of saying "it goes higher and higher more fast" would be $f'(x)\propto f(x)$, meaning that the function $f(x)$ where the derivative of $f(x)$ is proportional to $f(x)$ for all values of x
