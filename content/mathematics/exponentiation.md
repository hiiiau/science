in mathematics, exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers - the base and the exponent

if you see something as a superscript on the upper right corner, it's probably an exponent.

for some reason, exponents are also called indicies

compare to [[logarithm|logarithms]]

you see, $2\div 7=2\cdot7^{-1}$
this means that division was a lie! it was just multiplication in disguise this whole time! :]
now that i think about it, subtraction is just addition in disguise...

and, $\sqrt[2]{7}=7^{\dfrac{1}{2}}$ and $\sqrt[3]{7}=7^{\dfrac{1}{3}}$
don't worry about all those fancy hats with numbers beside them because it's *all* exponents!

here should be everything you need to know about doing operations on exponents.

$a^0=1$

$a^1=a$

$(a \cdot b)^{c}=a^{c} \cdot b^{c}$

$a^{b}\cdot a^{c} = a^{(b+c)}$

$\dfrac{a^{b}}{a^{c}} = a^{(b-c)}$

$a^{-b}=\dfrac{1}{a^{b}}$

$a^{\dfrac{1}{b}}=\sqrt[b]{a}$

$(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$

$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$

$(a+b)^3=a^3+3ab^2+3a^2b+b^3$

$a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$

and from the above rules, we can derive the following statements:

$\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)^c = \dfrac{(a)^c}{(b)^c} = (a)^c\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}b\right)^c = a^c \cdot b^{-c}$

$a^2+ba=\left(a+\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2-\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2$

$a^2+ba+c=a\left(b-(-\dfrac{b}{2a})\right)^2+\left(c-\dfrac{b^2}{4a}\right)$

$\text{if }ax^2+bx+c=0\text{ then }x=\dfrac{-b\cdot\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
