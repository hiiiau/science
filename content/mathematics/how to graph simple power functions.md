You should remember the simple power functions in the form $f(x)=x^n$

We will now list the things you have to remember, one by one.

## the negatives

when $n<0$, there are vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### negative, odd on odd

Remember the graph of $f(x)=x^{-3}$

The limits are zero on the left, zero on the right.

So, zero to down, also, up to zero.







there are no asymptotes

remember the graph of $f(x)=x^3$
$\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty$
$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$

the graph goes from bottom left to top right

## n is an even positive integer

there are no asymptotes

remember the graph of $f(x)=x^4$
$\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\infty$
$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$

the graph goes from top left to top right

## n is an even negative integer

there is a vertical asymptote and a horizontal asymptote

remember the graph of $f(x)=x^{-4}$
$\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=0$
$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=0$

the graph starts and ends at the horizontal asymptote

## n is an odd positive integer to the power of -1

there are no asymptotes

remember the graph of $f(x)=x^{\frac{1}{3}}$
$\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty$
$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$

the graph goes from bottom left to top right

## n is an even positive integer to the power of -1

there are no asymptotes

the function does not output a real number when $b(x-d)<0$, since for $k$ is an even integer, $(-1)^{\frac{1}{k}}$ is not a real number

remember the graph of $f(x)=x^{\frac{1}{4}}$
the graph goes from the 

the graph goes from a point to top right
