This is a part of [[guide to graphing functions]].

A [[power function]] is a function in the form $f(x)=a[b(x-d)]^n+c$




Firstly, you must be familiar with simple power functions, in the form $f(x)=x^n$, where the value of $n$ dramatically changes the graph. See [[how to graph simple power functions]].

From there, we will then apply transformations.



So, a function in the form $f(x)=a[b(x-d)]^n+c$

- $a$ will make the graph reflect vertically if sign change
- the absolute value of $a$ is proportional to the graph's vertical stretch (any $|a|$ below 1 will vertically compress the graph; any $|a|$ above 1 will vertically expand the graph)
- $b$ will make the graph reflect horizontally if sign change
- the absolute value of $k$ is inversely proportional to the graph's horizontal stretch (any $|k|$ below 1 will vertically expand the graph; any $|k|$ above 1 will vertically compress the graph)
- $d$ is the x coordinate of the point of inflection
- $c$ is the x coordinate of the point of inflection

$a$ and $c$ cause vertical transformation and therefore affect the y-coordinates of the function
$k$ and $d$ cause vertical transformation and therefore affect the x-coordinates of the function






for example, $f(x)=(2(x-1))^{-3}$ can be expressed as $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{[2(x-1)]^3}$

when the exponent of a power function is a fraction we can use algebra to express the function differently
for example, $f(x)=(2(x-1))^\dfrac{1}{3}$ can be expressed as $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{2(x-1)}$





picture $f(a)=a^\dfrac{1}{n}=\dfrac{1}{a^n}$ where $a$ and $n$ are constants
if $n$ is even, $a^\dfrac{1}{n}$ must be positive

if $n$ is odd, $a^\dfrac{1}{n}$ must have the same sign as $a$
