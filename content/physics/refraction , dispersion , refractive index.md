## refractive index

The refractive index is a ratio of "the speed of light" to "the speed of light in a specific medium", at specific values of the following conditions:
- frequency (therefore wavelength) of the light
- 

For example, the 

## intro

Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LebJXjbkfo) because it's really good.

The normal line passes through the point of incidence and is perpendicular to the surface.

$n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indicies of the mediums.

$\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence, measured from the normal.
$\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction, measured from the normal.

## Snell's law

Now, the relationships between the refractive index things and the angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ is described by Snell's law.
The first part of Snell's law is $n_1\sin(\theta_1)=n_2\sin(\theta_2)$
The second part of Snell's law is $n_1v_1=n_2v_2$. Remember that $v=\lambda f$.

If $n_2$ is larger, angle of refraction is smaller. If smaller, angle of refraction is larger.

## critical angle and internal reflection

When the angle of refraction $\theta_2=90\degree$, the ray will travel perpendicular to the normal line.

Snell's law says that $n_1\sin(\theta_1)=n_2\sin(\theta_2)$.

Directly coming from Snell's law, $\theta_1=\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot \sin(\theta_2))$.

Directly coming from Snell's law, $\theta_{\text{crit}}=\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1})$, because $\theta_2=90\degree$

If $\theta_1=\theta_{\text{crit}}$ then $\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot \sin(\theta_2))=\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1})$ then $\theta_2=90\degree$

Internal reflection is when the angle of incidence $\theta_1$ is greater than the critical angle, and it means $\theta_2$ must be undefined.

If $\theta_1>\theta_{\text{crit}}$ then $\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot \sin(\theta_2))>\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1})$  which simplifies to $\sin(\theta_2)>1$. This is impossible, making $\theta_2$ undefined.

So, there is no refraction, but reflection instead.

For internal reflection to be possible, $n_2>n_1$ which in other words 

Directly coming from Snell's law, $\theta_1=\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot \sin(\theta_2))$.
$\theta_2 = 90\degree$
Substitute $\theta_2 = 90\degree$ into $\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot \sin(\theta_2))$

$\therefore \sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot \sin(90\degree))$ 

$\theta_1=\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot1)$

$\theta_1=\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1})$

$\theta_1>\theta_2$

So $\sin^{-1}(\dfrac{n_2}{n_1})>90\degree$

$\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}>\sin(90\degree)$

$\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}>1$

$n_2>n_1$
