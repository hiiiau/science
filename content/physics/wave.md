Electromagnetic radiation from the sun is mostly in the ==infrared, visible and ultraviolet== spectrum.

Waves need a ==medium== to travel. Unlike matter.

The qualities of a wave include ==wavelength, amplitude and frequency.==
```

```anki

---
For a periodic wave, the wavelength is ==the distance between two identical parts of the wave. For example, the distance crest to crest.== Represented with lambda $\lambda$.
```

---
For a periodic wave, the amplitude is {the distance that measures how far the wave travels away from the equilibrium position. Represented with $A$}
```

---
For a periodic wave, the frequency is ==the number of cycles the wave completes over time.== Frequency is measured in ==cycles per second, 1 cycle per second is 1 hertz.== Represented with $f$.
```

For a periodic wave, the period is ==the time it takes for one wavelength to travel through the medium.== Represented with $T$.
```

```anki

The relationship between frequency and period is ==$Tf=1$==.

A longitudinal wave is characterized by ==the oscillation of particles in the medium parallel to the direction of wave propagation.==
```

A transverse wave is characterized by ==the oscillation of particles in the medium perpedicular to the direction of wave propagation.==
```

```anki

Examples of transverse waves include ==water waves, string waves, electromagnetic and light waves.==
```

Examples of transverse waves include ==sound waves, pressure waves, and compression waves.==

The propagation velocity of a wave is calculated with ==frequency times wavelength, $f \lambda$==, which is equal to the wave velocity of the medium. Represented with $v$.

A black body is ==an idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, which means it doesn't reflect light.==
```

The electromagnetic spectrum regions ordered by decreasing frequency is ==gamma, X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave, and radio waves.==

The refractive index of a medium is ==a ratio to measure the relative speed of light through the medium.== It is calculated with ==the speed of light in a vacuum over the average speed of in the medium.==

Question. Calculate the speed of light in olive oil, given it has a refractive index of 1.47. ==Let $x$ be the answer. We are told that $1.47=\dfrac==3\cdot 10^8====x==$, so $x=2.04\cdot 10^8$ (m/s)==

Snell's law is ==$n_1\sin(\theta_1)=n_2\sin(\theta_2)$ and $n_1v_1=n_2v_2$==
```

The critical angle is ==an angle of the incidence that makes the angle of refraction equal to 90 degrees.== 
```

```anki
id: 1740272617449
---
Internal reflection describes when ==the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.== This causes ==the angle of refraction to be undefined, and the refracted ray reflects at the normal line.==

The transmission speed of thermal energy, besides the medium, is dependent on ==the temperature difference, the surface area of contact.==

The specific heat capacity is ==the amount of thermal energy used to change 1 kg of a material by 1 kelvin.== Units are $\text{J}\cdot\text{kg}^{-1}\cdot\text{K}^{-1}$. Represented with $c$.}
```


 ```anki
 The relationship between an object's additional thermal energy $Q$ joules, mass $m$ kg, specific heat capacity $c$, and change in temperature $\Delta T$ kelvin, is ==$Q=mc\Delta T$==

Latent heat is ==the thermal energy change during a change in state of the material. For each material there is a latent heat of fusion and a latent heat of vaporization. The temperature will not change until all the latent heat is provided and the state finishes changing.==
