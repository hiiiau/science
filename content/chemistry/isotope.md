isotopes are distinct nuclear species of the same chemical element

they have the same atomic number and position in the periodic table, but differ in nucleon numbers due to different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei

while all isotopes of a given element have similar chemical properties, they have different atomic masses and physical properties
