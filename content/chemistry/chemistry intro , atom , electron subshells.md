## atoms

An atom is the smallest unit of matter.

An element is a unit in the periodic table, with a unique number of protons.

A molecule is two or more atoms bonded.

A compound is two more atoms of different elements bonded.

The mass number of an atom is the sum of the protons and neutrons.

The atomic number is the number of protons.

In notation, the mass number is above the atomic number, for example ${}^{13}_{6}\mathrm{C}$.

An isotope is a variant of an element with unique number of neutrons.

An atom that has no charge must have the same number of protons and electrons.

## electron subshells

An atom has a limited number of electron spots available at orbitals, so these different electron shells correspond to different levels of electron energy.

An atom has subshells. A subshell is identified with a shell number and a subshell letter.

There are 4 subshell types. You can use speed fast to help memorize the subshells, "spdf".

- s subshells can contain 2 electrons.
- p subshells can contain 6 electrons.
- d subshells can contain 10 electrons.
- f subshells can contain 14 electrons.



Figure: These are all the subshells.

Figure: The subshells electron filling order. The shells of lower energy levels are filled first. So the order is 1s, 2s, 2p, 2s, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s...

Figure: Subshells and distance from the nucleus. See that the order can be confusing.

Normally the electrons fill the shells in the normal order, but excited electron shells can leave some empty spots as they jump from lower to higher energy subshells.

## block

Elements can be organized into blocks, which is the type of subshell that the last electron occupies. The number of electrons the subshells can hold, 2, 6, and 10 correspond to the width of the block.

Figure: Blocks of the periodic table. Groups 1-2 are s block, Groups 13-18 are p block except for helium.
