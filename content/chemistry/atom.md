the atom is the basic particle of the [[chemical element|chemical elements]]

an atom consists of a nucleus of protons an generally electrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons

atoms are around 100 picometers across

more than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus
protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge, so the nucleus is positively charged

the electrons are negatively charged, and this opposing charge is what binds them to the nucleus
