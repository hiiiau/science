## noun

Nouns refer to names of concepts.

A noun is something that can take the word "a/the" in front of it, or can form a plural.

Common nouns refer to things generally. They are lower case and can be modified by adjectives and determiners.


Proper nouns are specific rather than generic, and are capitalized. They are not usually modified by adjectives or determiners.
